We are working on the flatpak version of the GAMBAS app. The Gambas developers do not yet realize that Flatpak is the way to go with regards to sotware distribution becaue they feel it is eaier to implement, or perhaps the were promised support from appimage developers. 
. 
I am working on developing the flatpak, but I do not have all of the skills nbecesaey to build it.
anyone who can assist or whould like to see a flatpak version of Gambas, please email me. 

In order to eliminate confusion, this project will be rebranded STORCKE64 Basic. 
Once the Gambas tream has relased  a flatpak then this project will likley cease. 

We have other projects relating to computer software avd will be using GAMBAS as our foundational technology.
