   'How to demonstrate the bug:
   
   'Step1:
   'Start the program, mark one item in the list and click delete.
   'In the IDE console you will see the number of selected items before and after the removal of the selected item in the IDE console.
   'Other than expected, the number of selected items persists after having delete one or more.
   ' 
   'Step 2:
   'Start the program, turn off the multi selection mode, mark one item And click On delete.
   'This time it shows that the number of selected items after removel is zero - as expected.


  'Set listview to multi-select mode
  CheckBox1.Value = True

  ListView1.Add(0, "Item 0", Picture["picturebox.png"])
  For I = 1 To 5
    ListView1.Add(i, "Item " & Str(i))  
  Next

End
