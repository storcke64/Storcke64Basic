.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gambas is, before all, a Basic language with object extensions.
A program written with Gambas is a set of files. Each file describes
a class, in terms of object programming. The class files are compiled,
then executed by an interpreter. From this point of view, it is
very inspired by Java.

Gambas is made up of the following programs:

    * A compiler.
    * An interpreter.
    * An archiver.
    * A graphical user interface component.
    * A development environment.

The development environment is written with Gambas itself, so that you can
see the abilities of the language.

\fBgambas3\fR starts the Integrated Development Environment.
